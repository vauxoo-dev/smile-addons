    This module aims to export data in a new module containing CSV files.

    This module built and test on OpenERP.

    Features
        * Export data in CSV or XML through a new module compatible with import (i.e. data files are ordered and splitted if necessary)
        * Export automatically properties linked to selected models

    TODO
        * Manage workflow - Eg.: export a validated invoice and import it at this same state, in particular if account moves were exported
